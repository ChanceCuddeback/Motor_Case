# Motor_Case

This library will host the solidworks files for the motor case. The motor case will house two TMotor AK80-9 BLDC actuators, a battery, a PCB. The case will also serve to support the motors drive shaft, and terminate the bowden cables. Ideally the case will allow for quick change batteries, and access to the usb port of the microcontroller.
